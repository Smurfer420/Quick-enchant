# Quickenchant
Are you tired of enchanting your items one enchant after another, one by one?  
Me too thats why i created this mod!

## Features

- Automatic enchants for all you items using /quickenchant
- customizable delay to prevent being kicked
- an "Incompatible" mode, where every Incompatible enchant will be applied (if possible)

## Usage
you can just type /quickenchant {item}  
but to use all features, type:  
/quickenchant {item_name} {delay in second (only full numbers)} allowIncompatible
or use /fastenchant if your server uses a plugin for /enchant.
